# Developer Resources Vault

A growing, curated collection of resources, tools, and references for developers of all levels. This repo exists as a grab-bag of useful links, structured documentation, code snippets, and API directories. Whether you're tinkering on side projects or building production-grade apps, this is your Swiss Army knife.

## What's Inside

> This repo will evolve over time. Expect categories like these:

### API Collections
- A list of [free APIs for frontend development](./free-apis-for-frontend-development/README.md), grouped by topic (weather, finance, games, etc.)

### Learning & Reference Materials _(Coming Soon)_
- Cheatsheets, doc links, blog posts worth bookmarking.
- Pinned guides and how-tos for common dev problems.

### Toolkits & Utilities _(Coming Soon)_
- Browser extensions, CLI tools, npm packages that save you time.
- VSCode settings, Git aliases, Docker templates, etc.

### Snippets & Templates _(Coming Soon)_
- Useful boilerplate or code snippets for common tasks.

## Why?

Because keeping track of useful stuff shouldn't be a mess of bookmarks and post-it notes. This is my evolving dev toolbox – feel free to fork it or contribute.

## Contributing

Got a tool, API, or tip? PRs are welcome! Just try to keep it tidy and categorised.
