# Best Free Icon Generation Tools

Finding the right tool can save you a lot of time when creating multi-resolution app icons and favicons from a single image. Below is a curated list of free (or freemium with sufficient free features) tools that automatically generate icons in various standard sizes and formats from one high-resolution source image.

## Icon Generation Tools

### [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net)
An all-in-one favicon generator for websites and web apps. Upload one image and get a full set of favicons for all major browsers and platforms (desktop, iOS, Android, etc.), including legacy ICO files and even modern SVG favicons. It provides a downloadable package with all icon files and the HTML/manifest code needed to integrate them. This tool is completely free and does not watermark, making it perfect for web projects.

### [AppIconGenerator](https://appicongenerator.co)
A comprehensive online app icon generator that covers mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop platforms. You simply upload a single 1024×1024 image, and it automatically produces all the necessary icon PNG files for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, macOS, and Android in their required resolutions. There's also a built-in favicon generator for web needs. All output images are offered as a structured ZIP download for convenience. The service is free to use with no sign-up or watermarks.

### [AppIconMaker](https://appiconmaker.co)
A free cloud-based app icon maker focused on mobile app icons. It generates all required icon sizes for iOS and Android automatically. Simply upload a high-res PNG/JPG/GIF, and it will output a set of optimized PNG icons for iPhone, iPad, Android densities, etc. You can download the results as a ZIP archive (either a single bundle or separate zips per platform) for easy integration into Xcode, Android Studio, or Visual Studio projects. It supports a wide range of input formats and has an easy drag-and-drop interface.

### [EasyAppIcon](https://easyappicon.com)
A free tool tailored for mobile developers that even covers Android adaptive icons. You upload your base image (with optional separate foreground/background for adaptive icons) and it generates all necessary iOS icons and Android launcher icons (legacy and adaptive) automatically. It provides an instant preview and lets you choose an adaptive icon background color. All the resized PNG files can be downloaded for use in your app (no watermarks). This is especially handy if you need round and legacy Android icons along with standard iOS assets.

### [Icon Set Creator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/icon-set-creator/id939343785)
A free macOS application available on the App Store that simplifies creating iOS/macOS app icons offline. You give it a single large image (1024×1024 or bigger), and it generates an .appiconset folder containing PNG icons at all the required sizes for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, etc., along with the Contents.json asset catalog file. This tool covers all Apple platform icon requirements in one go. It's an ideal choice for Mac users who want a quick, native solution without any cost.

### [Greenfish Icon Editor Pro](https://greenfish-icon-editor-pro.en.lo4d.com)
A free and open-source downloadable program for creating and converting icons. While it's a full-featured icon editor, it also excels at batch-exporting multiple sizes. You can import a high-res image and export it to ICO (Windows icon) or ICNS (Mac icon) files containing multiple resolutions, or export a series of PNGs for various sizes. Greenfish supports all common icon formats (ICO, PNG, ICNS, CUR, etc.) and can create icons for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android apps. It's a great free option if you need desktop app icons (e.g. an .ico for Windows executables) or prefer an offline tool with more control.
